<!-- ### Course Description

The course is structured in two major parts, each focusing on distinct areas of advanced optimization techniques and their practical applications. This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of both convex optimization and integer programming, equipping them with the skills necessary to tackle complex optimization problems in various fields.

### Part 1: Convex Optimization
The first part of the course focuses on **Convex Optimization**, beginning with unconstrained convex problems. We compare these to the already familiar Linear Programs (LPs), which, while easier to solve due to their linearity, can become more challenging when hard constraints are introduced. 

We will cover the theoretical foundations of convex optimization, focusing on problem geometry, optimality conditions, and duality principles. Students will also learn to identify convexity and model real-world scenarios as convex formulations. Practical applications are reinforced through hands-on experience with solvers like CVX, ensuring a balance between conceptual understanding and implementation.

If time allows, this part will explore advanced topics such as:
- **Robust Optimization** for handling uncertainty in optimization problems.
- **Online Optimization** for sequential decision-making scenarios.

These topics serve to bridge the gap between theoretical optimization techniques and their practical applications in modern data-driven decision-making contexts.

### Part 2: Integer Programming (IP)
The second part of the course covers **Integer Programming (IP)**, beginning with fundamental concepts of modeling real-world problems using integer constraints. Students will learn to implement these models using industry-standard software tools while developing a deep understanding of the geometric principles and solution techniques that underpin IP.

This section examines what makes some IP formulations more tractable than others, highlighting special cases that can be solved efficiently using core algorithms covered earlier. General algorithmic approaches such as:
- **Branch and Bound**,
- **Cutting Plane Methods**, and
- **Dynamic Programming**

will also be explored and implemented. -->

<!-- ### Course Materials
The course will utilize a combination of textbooks, research papers, and software tools. Key resources include:
- Textbook: "Convex Optimization" by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe
- Research papers and articles provided throughout the course
- Software: CVX for convex optimization, and CPLEX or Gurobi for integer programming -->

<!-- ### Assessment
Assessment will be based on a combination of homework assignments, projects, and exams. Homework assignments will reinforce theoretical concepts and practical skills, while projects will provide an opportunity to apply optimization techniques to real-world problems. Exams will test students' understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the course material. -->

<!-- ### Prerequisites
Students are expected to have completed IEOR 3608 (Foundations of Optimization) or have equivalent knowledge. A strong foundation in linear algebra, calculus, and basic optimization techniques is essential for success in this course. -->
