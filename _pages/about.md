I am an Assistant Professor in [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu). My research sits at the intersection of continuous and discrete optimization. On the continuous side, I develop algorithms for linear, quadratic, and semidefinite programming, with a particular emphasis on strongly polynomial methods for network optimization and more general structured linear programs. On the discrete side, I work on combinatorial optimization and approximation algorithms.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about research or potential collaborations.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> (2022--2024), the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage" target="_blank">Simons Institute</a> at UC Berkeley (<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/data-structures-optimization-fast-algorithms" target="_blank">Data Structures and Optimization for Fast Algorithms</a>, Fall 2023), and <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu" target="_blank">ICERM</a> at Brown University (<a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s23/" target="_blank">Discrete Optimization</a>, Spring 2023).

I received my PhD in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Mathematics" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://lse.ac.uk" target="_blank">London School of Economics</a>, supervised by <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl" target="_blank">L&aacute;szl&oacute; V&eacute;gh</a> and funded by his <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/" target="_blank">ERC</a> grant <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/scaleopt.html" target="_blank">ScaleOpt</a>. I also hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/" target="_blank">University of Bonn</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~held/Stephan_Held.html" target="_blank">Stephan Held</a> and <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~vygen/" target="_blank">Jens Vygen</a>.
