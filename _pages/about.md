I am an Assistant Professor in [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://ieor.columbia.edu). My research interests lie in algorithms, optimization, and game theory.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Georgia Tech](https://www.isye.gatech.edu) (2022--2024), the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley ([Data Structures and Optimization for Fast Algorithms](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/data-structures-optimization-fast-algorithms), Fall 2023), and [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu) at Brown University ([Discrete Optimization](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s23/), Spring 2023).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about research or potential collaborations.
