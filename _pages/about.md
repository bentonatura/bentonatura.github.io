I am an Assistant Professor in [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://ieor.columbia.edu).


From 2022 to 2024 I spent two years as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Georgia Tech](https://www.isye.gatech.edu).
In Fall 2023, I was a PostDoc at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley for a program in [Data Structures and Optimization for Fast Algorithms](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/data-structures-optimization-fast-algorithms). In Spring 2023, I was a PostDoc at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu) at Brown University for a program in [Discrete Optimization](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s23/).

I received my PhD in the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Mathematics" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at the <a href="http://lse.ac.uk" target="_blank">London School of Economics</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl" target="_blank">L&aacute;szl&oacute;
V&eacute;gh</a>, funded by his <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/" target="_blank">ERC</a> grant <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/scaleopt.html" target="_blank">ScaleOpt</a>.


I also hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/), where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~held/Stephan_Held.html" target="_blank">Stephan Held</a> and <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~vygen/" target="_blank">Jens Vygen</a>.

My current research interests are focused on the areas of algorithms, optimization, and game theory.
