I also hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mathematics from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university/), where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~held/Stephan_Held.html" target="_blank">Stephan Held</a> and <a href="http://www.or.uni-bonn.de/~vygen/" target="_blank">Jens Vygen</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
